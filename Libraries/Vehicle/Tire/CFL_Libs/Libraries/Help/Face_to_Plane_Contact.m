%% Face to Plane Contact Force (3D)
% 
% This subsystem implements a contact force between a plane and a square
% face. The plane is assumed significantly larger than the face such that
% the edges will never intersect.  The force is active above and below the
% plane and face.
%
% This is part of the <matlab:web('Contact_Forces_Demo_Script.html'); Simscape Multibody Contact Forces Library>
