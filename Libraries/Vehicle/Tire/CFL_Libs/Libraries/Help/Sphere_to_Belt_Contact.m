%% Sphere to Belt Contact Force (3D)
% 
% This block implements a contact force between a sphere and a moving belt
% with round ends.  The force is active above, below, and on the ends of
% the belt.  The belt can move

% Frame connected to BelB port:
%
% # Located at midpoint of plane (x, y, and z).
% # Z-axis is normal to the surfaces where force is active. 
% 
% Frame connected to the SphF port:
% 
% # Located at center of sphere.
% # Orientation does not matter.
% 
% Output signal is a bus with intermediate calculations and total force.
%
% Input signal is a bus that enables the force and controls belt speed.
