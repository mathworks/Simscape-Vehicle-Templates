%% Vehicle with Fuel Cell Powertrain
% 
% This example shows a fuel cell powertrain modeled in Simscape.  A single
% fuel cell stack in parallel with a battery powers a single motor that
% propels the vehicle. The fuel cell is modeled using a custom domain to
% track the different species of gas that are used in the fuel cell.  The
% vehicle can be tested on custom drive cycles or using the Drive Cycle
% Source from Powertrain Blockset.

%% Powertrain Subsystem
%
% The fuel cell and battery are connected on a DC electrical network to the
% motor.  The control system determines how much power to draw from the
% battery and fuel cell.  During braking events, power is fed back into the
% battery to recharge it.  A thermal system modeled using a fluid network
% controls the temperature of the battery, DC-DC converters, and the motor.

%% Fuel Cell Subsystem
%
% The flow of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and water is captured in a custom
% Simscape domain.  Equations for reactions and heat generated are
% implemented in Simscape language.  A thermal management system keeps the
% fuel cell at the optimal operating temperature.

% Plot shows how the current from the battery and fuel cell vary as the car
% is driven along a standard drive cycle.  Note that the battery is
% recharged (current changes sign) while the fuel cell is only discharged.
