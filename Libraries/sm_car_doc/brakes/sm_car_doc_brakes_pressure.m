% This subsystem models the brakes for all four corners of the vehicle,
% The pressure applied to the brake is controlled by an input signal
% representing the pressure at each brake caliper.

%% Overview
%
% The Pressure variant of the brake subsystem has: 
% 
% * Simscape Bus connections for each corner 
% * Input signal bus for the control of the braking system
% * Input signal bus for inputs from the driver (brake caliper pressure)

%% Model
%
% The brake caliper and pads are modeled using the Disc Brake block from
% Simscape Driveline.  The actuators are ideal with a first order filter to
% smooth the input to the brakes.
%
% The input signal to each actuator is the pressure at the brake caliper.
% This permits the brake pressure to be calculated by an external function
% for empirical models of brake hydraulic systems and to include the
% effects of the control system.
%
% The control signals are not used in this variant.
