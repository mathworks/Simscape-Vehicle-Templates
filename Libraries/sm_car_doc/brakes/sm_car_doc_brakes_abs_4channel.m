% This subsystem models the brakes for all four corners of the vehicle,
% The pressure applied to the brake is controlled by pressure at the master
% cylinder and commands to the apply and release valves at each corner.

%% Overview
%
% The ABS 4 Channel variant of the brake subsystem has: 
% 
% * Simscape Bus connections for each corner 
% * Input signal bus for the control of the braking system (valve control)
% * Input signal bus for inputs from the driver (brake pedal displacement)

%% Model
%
% The brake caliper and pads are modeled using the Disc Brake block from
% Simscape Driveline.  The actuators are hydraulic cylinders with valves to
% control the flow of fluid between the master cylinder and the brake caliper.
%
% The control signal to each actuator are the signals to the apply and
% release valves.  This permits the controller to apply, hold, and release
% pressure at each wheel.  This basic function is required for most
% anti-lock braking systems.
%
% The input signal from the driver is the amount that the brake pedal is
% depressed.  This signal varies from 0 to 1.

%% Hydraulic
%
% A very basic hydraulic system is implemented using ideal pressure sources
% for the master cylinder pressure.
