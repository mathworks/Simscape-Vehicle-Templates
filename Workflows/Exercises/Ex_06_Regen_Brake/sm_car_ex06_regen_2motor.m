%% Explore Regenerative Braking
% 
% The commands below run the vehicle through a braking test so that we can
% see how torque from the regenerative braking system and conventional
% brakes is blended by a serial regenerative braking algorithm.  The driver
% accelerates, releases the accelerator pedal, and then applies the brakes.
% The level of braking requested by the driver is different in the two
% events. We can see differences in the torque applied by the regenerative
% and conventional brakes, both during the maneuver and in the two separate
% tests. We plot data from Simscape Logging in the Simulink Data Inspector
% to explore the simulation results.

%% Step 1: Open Model
% This can be done from the MATLAB UI, project shortcut, or MATLAB Command
% line.
mdl = 'sm_car';
open_system(mdl)

%% Step 2: Configure Model to Stream Simscape Logging to Simulink Data Inspector
% This can be done from the MATLAB Command line or Configuration Panel
set_param(mdl,'SimscapeLogToSDI','on')

%% Step 3: Configure Vehicle Model
% This can be done from the MATLAB UI or the MATLAB Command line.  It
% involves loading a data structure into the MATLAB workspace that includes
% the desired vehicle model configuration and parameters

%% Step 4: Select Event
% This can be done from the MATLAB UI or the MATLAB Command line. It
% configures the driver model for open/closed loop maneuvers and loads the
% necessary parameters into the MATLAB workspace.

% The plot shows the actions the driver will take during this maneuver.
% You can produce this plot from the MATLAB UI or the MATLAB Command line.

%% Step 5: Modify Event
% Adjust maneuver to show torque blending of conventional and regenerative
% brakes.  A few vectors of data in the MATLAB workspace so that the
% vehicle is going faster when the brakes are first applied and the brake
% request is reduced so that more torque comes from the regenerative
% brakes.

% Achieve higher speed to show torque limit of motor
% Accelerate for longer
Maneuver.Accel.t.Value(4:5)      = [14 14.2];
% Increase acceleration torque request
Maneuver.Accel.rPedal.Value(3:4) = [0.8 0.8];

% Start braking later
Maneuver.Brake.t.Value(2:3)      = [15 15.2];
% Lower braking request so more regenerative braking can be used
Maneuver.Brake.rPedal.Value(3:4) = [0.5 0.5];
