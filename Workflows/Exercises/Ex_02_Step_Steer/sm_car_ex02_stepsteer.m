%% Customize Step Steer Test
% 
% The commands below run the vehicle through a step steer test by modifying
% the parameters for a maneuver.  In the adjusted maneuver, the driver
% accelerates, releases the accelerator pedal, and then applies a step
% input to the steering wheel.  The final steering angle differs in the two
% tests, and we can see differences in roll angle and vehicle speed. The
% Simulink Data Inspector let us easily compare vehicle body measurements.

%% Step 1: Open Model
% This can be done from the MATLAB UI, project shortcut, or MATLAB Command
% line.
mdl = 'sm_car';
open_system(mdl)

%% Step 2: Configure Model
% This can be done from the MATLAB UI or the MATLAB Command line.  It
% involves loading a data structure into the MATLAB workspace that includes
% the desired vehicle model configuration and parameters
sm_car_load_vehicle_data(mdl,'189'); % Multibody tire, R21b and higher

%% Step 3: Select Event
% This can be done from the MATLAB UI or the MATLAB Command line. It
% configures the driver model for open/closed loop maneuvers and loads the
% necessary parameters into the MATLAB workspace.
% 
% The plot shows the actions the driver will take during this maneuver.
% You can produce this plot from the MATLAB UI or the MATLAB Command line.
sm_car_config_maneuver('sm_car','Turn');
sm_car_plot_maneuver(Maneuver)
subplot(311);
set(gca,'XLim', [0 30])

%% Step 4: Modify Event
% Configure a step steer with no braking.  This is done by modifying a few
% vectors of data in the MATLAB workspace so that the steering input takes
% place after the driver has released the accelerator pedal and so that the
% driver does not step on the brakes during the test.

% Adjust nominal steering angle
Maneuver.Steer.aWheel.Value = [0 0    -0.08 -0.08   0   0];

% Adjust time for steering input to take place after accelerator pedal has
% been released
Maneuver.Steer.t.Value      = [0 11.0 11.2 180  181 200];

% Adjust time for brake input to take place after test is complete (no
% braking)
Maneuver.Brake.t.Value      = [0 100 100.2 180  181 200];

sm_car_plot_maneuver(Maneuver)
subplot(311);
set(gca,'XLim', [0 30])

%% Step 5: Run simulation with nominal damping
% This can be done from Simulink or from the MATLAB command line.
sim(mdl)

%% Step 6: Explore simulation results in Simulink Data Inspector
% Use the Simulink Data Inspector to plot the following quantities:

sm_car_ex02_stepsteer_plot1

%% Step 7: Increase step input to the steering wheel
% Adjusting these numerical values in the Maneuver data structure will
% increase the magnitude of the steering input.

Maneuver.Steer.aWheel.Value = [0 0    -0.125 -0.125   0   0];

%% Step 8: Run simulation with increased steer angle
% This can be done from Simulink or from the MATLAB command line.
sim(mdl)

%% Step 9: Add simulation results to the Simulink Data Inspector
% Use the Simulink Data Inspector to plot the following quantities from the
% both runs.

sm_car_ex02_stepsteer_plot2
