%% Configure Vehicle for Double Lane Change
% 
% The commands below run the vehicle through a double-lane change with
% two distinct vehicle configurations.  The driver attempts to follow a
% specific trajectory (speed and yaw angle vs. x-y position).  In one
% configuration we enable the anti-roll bar, in the other we disable it. The
% Simulink Data Inspector let us easily compare vehicle body measurements.

%% Step 1: Open Model
% This can be done from the MATLAB app, project shortcut, or MATLAB Command
% line.
mdl = 'sm_car';
open_system(mdl)

%% Step 2: Configure Model
% This can be done from the MATLAB app or the MATLAB Command line.  It
% involves loading a data structure into the MATLAB workspace that includes
% the desired vehicle model configuration and parameters
if verLessThan('matlab', '9.11')
    sm_car_load_vehicle_data(mdl,'139'); % MFeval tire
else
    sm_car_load_vehicle_data(mdl,'189'); % Multibody tire, R21b and higher
end

%% Step 3: Select Event
% This can be done from the MATLAB app or the MATLAB Command line. It
% configures the driver model for open/closed loop maneuvers and loads the
% necessary parameters into the MATLAB workspace.
% 
% The plot shows the actions the driver will take during this maneuver.
% You can produce this plot from the MATLAB app or the MATLAB Command line.

%% Step 4: Run simulation with anti-roll bar active
% This can be done from Simulink or from the MATLAB command line.

sim(mdl)

%% Step 5: Explore simulation results in Simulink Data Inspector
% Use the Simulink Data Inspector to plot the following quantities.

sm_car_ex03_dlc_arb_plot1

%% Step 6: Remove anti-roll bar from front and rear of Vehicle data structure
% This adjustment to the Vehicle data structure can be done via the MATLAB
% app or MATLAB Command Window.  We are changing the configuration of the
% vehicle by changing fields in Vehicle that indicate if the anti-roll bar
% is present or not.

Vehicle = sm_car_vehcfg_setAntiRollBar(Vehicle,'None','SuspA1');
Vehicle = sm_car_vehcfg_setAntiRollBar(Vehicle,'None','SuspA2');

%% Step 7: Trigger model update to match Vehicle data structure 
% Changes to the Vehicle data structure need to be applied to the model.
% This process can be triggered by the MATLAB app or the MATLAB command
% line
sm_car_config_vehicle('sm_car');

%%
% Note that anti-roll bar has been removed

%% Step 8: Run simulation with no anti-roll bar
% This can be done from Simulink or from the MATLAB command line.
sim(mdl)

%% Step 9: Add simulation results to the Simulink Data Inspector
% Use the Simulink Data Inspector to plot the following quantities from the
% both runs.

sm_car_ex03_dlc_arb_plot2

%% Step 10: Add anti-roll bar to front and rear in Vehicle data structure
% This adjustment to the Vehicle data structure can be done via the MATLAB
% app or MATLAB Command Window.  We are changing the configuration of the
% vehicle by changing fields in Vehicle that indicate if the anti-roll bar
% is present or not.

Vehicle = sm_car_vehcfg_setAntiRollBar(Vehicle,'Droplink_Sedan_Hamba_r','SuspA2');

%% Step 11: Trigger model update to match Vehicle data structure 
% Changes to the Vehicle data structure need to be applied to the model.
% This process can be triggered by the MATLAB app or the MATLAB command
% line
